# AirportGuide-App


Usually when people travel they need simple things with them at all times and our application provides just that. 
Users usually prefer to have everything in one place especially when it comes to finding critical information in a limited amount of time. 
Usually it’s hard to find information about airports in an app so our app allows the user to find airport information and achieve other functionalities 
all in one app. Also, AirportGuide provides information about nearby restaurants which can be helpful for the travelers especially 
if they are in a foreign place. This app also, allows users to check the weather with detailed information.

When the user launches the app, the user is greeted with the login page where the user can enter into the app by using FaceID feature 
where if it’s successfully passed then the user is allowed into the app. The user can also get into the app by entering in the password. 
I have also implemented the forgot password button on the login page which allows the user to change the password using the security question. 
Users can set up the password in the settings tab where the user has to enter the password as well as enter the security question’s answer. 
The forgot password is only displayed when the user has setup the password and answered the security question.

the Airport tab provides a database of Airports the user can navigate through and search. 
Information such as location, city, state, time zone, etc.. I also implemented the option to search through the database using the name of 
airport, city, and state. All this is implemented into one tab for ease of accessibility and not to confuse the user on where to find contents.

Once a person arrives at a new place, food is usually what they look for. the app provides Zomato API functionality where the user 
can enter a radius in meters to search for nearby restaurants and view information regarding that place. If the user is visiting a friend, 
a share button is ready to be used to share details about the restaurant with the tap of a button and also having the ability to find directions 
to the restaurant by clicking the car icon that is present in the details.

Before exiting the airport the user can navigate to the weather tab to view the weather relative to what input the user gives. 
he input needed is the city and state in which our app will display important weather details and therefore will be informed whether 
he/she needs to make any changes before going out. 

In conclusion, this app brings all the functionality that a user needs when visiting new places and it puts everything into one app.
